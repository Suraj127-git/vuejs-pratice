Repository for Basic Vue.js Projects

Welcome to the Vue.js Projects repository! Here you'll find a collection of basic Vue.js projects, each focusing on different aspects of Vue.js development. Whether you're new to Vue.js or looking to explore specific features, these projects serve as excellent learning resources.

## Project Structure

The repository maintains a consistent structure across all projects for easy navigation and understanding. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find in each project directory:

1. **`src`**: This directory contains the Vue.js application code, including components, views, and other Vue-specific files.

2. **`public`**: Contains static assets like images, fonts, and any other files that need to be publicly accessible.

3. **`tests`**: Holds the test files for the project, including unit tests and end-to-end tests if applicable.

4. **`README.md`**: Each project comes with a detailed README file providing information about the project, its purpose, features, and how to run it.

## Getting Started

To dive into a specific project, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the corresponding README.md file. These instructions typically include prerequisites, installation steps, and how to run the project locally.

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and Vue CLI installed on your system. You can install Vue CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
